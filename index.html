  <h1>To My Enigma — Happy Birthday, Mimi</h1>

  <p>I never thought I could have a friend. I always kept people at a distance close enough to smile, but never close enough to stay. I feared goodbyes, the kind that happen without warning. But then, I met you.</p>

  <p>Hey Mimi, you're an enigma. A rare soul clothed in chaos and kindness. You came like a knight in dining armor no swords, just patience. No war cries, just a quiet understanding that disarmed every wall I had ever built.</p>

  <p>She sat at the back and they called her reserved. She led from the front and they said she was proud. They pulled at her story, then dismissed the plot. She dimmed her shine and they asked why she stopped glowing. She bent to fit in and they called her fake. She stood tall and they called her too much.</p>

  <p>And she took it all in, wondering if she should be different until you reminded her she was already enough.</p>

  <p>You, with your effortless way of making heavy things feel light. You, who laughed when I couldn’t, and waited when I couldn’t speak. You, who showed me that real friendship isn’t loud or flashy it’s steady. It’s the quiet “I got you” in the middle of chaos. It’s knowing you’d fight for me even when I can’t fight for myself.</p>

  <p>I could skip a heartbeat, and I would survive. I could crash, fall, burn, and still find my way back. But a world without you? That’s a kind of emptiness I don’t ever want to feel.</p>

  <p>Life would not be the same without someone like you. You're there when I need you through the joy and the wreckage. We could go months without talking, but nothing would change. Because what we have is not fragile. It’s rooted, grown, sacred.</p>

  <p>So today, on your birthday, I don’t just celebrate your birth. I celebrate the day the universe decided I wasn’t meant to walk this life alone. Thank you for being my anchor, my mirror, my safe place. May this new year give you as much joy as you’ve given me. And then a little more.</p>

  <p class="signature">Love you always,<br>Your very lucky best friend.</p>
